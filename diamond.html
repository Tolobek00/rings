            The weight of diamonds is carat (English, carat, abbreviated as ct.)
            specified. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams and is divided into 100
            points. Therefore, a half a carat weighs 0.1 grams and has 50
            points. Not to be confused with the weight of a diamond to its size,
            which is additionally influenced by the dimensions of the diamond
            and the cut quality is. Important to know: all factors equal,
            diamond with a higher carat number of valuable as a diamond with
            less weight.<br />

            The word carat derives from the Greek word "Keration" as a name for
            the Pod of the carob tree, a mathematical miracle of nature: Every
            full-grown seed, the Bean has the same weight. A metric carat is
            equal to exactly 0.2 grams. Therefore, these seeds were used grains
            formerly used by jewellers as a reliable measure for the weight of
            Gold and precious stones.<br />

            For jewelry purposes of diamonds are used on all the sizes.
            Brilliant from 1/4 carat, are particularly suitable for Solitaire
            rings. In the following table, the various sizes of brilliant-cut
